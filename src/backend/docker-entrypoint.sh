# Shared entrypoint for the Insight backend service containers.
#
# Copied into the image by each service Dockerfile (api-gateway,
# analytics-api, identity). Behaviour switches on ENABLE_AUTO_RELOAD:
#
#   unset / anything else  : exec the command directly (prod default)
#   true | 1               : wrap the command in `watchexec` so that a
#                            change to the watched binary file triggers
#                            SIGTERM + respawn. Used by the local
#                            docker-compose dev stack with bind-mounted
#                            binaries.
#
# k8s policy: NEVER set ENABLE_AUTO_RELOAD in cluster manifests. The
# variable is opt-in by docker-compose only.
#
# Usage:  docker-entrypoint.sh <watched-path> -- <command> [args...]
