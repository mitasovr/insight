-- Live (`deals`) and archived (`deals_archived`) are sibling Bronze tables;
-- ReplacingMergeTree on `unique_key` dedups, with `_version = greatest(updatedAt, archivedAt)`
-- so an archive event always outranks the prior live update. The archived
-- sibling is only synced when Airbyte's HubSpot connector is configured to
-- backfill deleted records — guard the UNION with adapter.get_relation so
-- absent archived tables don't break the build. Derive the bronze schema
-- from the dbt source so a tenant-prefixed `bronze_hubspot_<tenant>` rename
-- doesn't silently drop the archived UNION arm.
