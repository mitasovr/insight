-- Bronze → Silver step 1: ChatGPT Team per-user per-day Codex usage → class_ai_dev_usage.
--
-- Source: bronze_chatgpt_team.chatgpt_team_codex_user_daily — daily aggregate
-- pulled via the customer-deployed chatgpt-team-proxy from chatgpt.com's
-- /backend-api/wham/analytics/usage-leaderboard. One row per (email, date).
--
-- Column contract MUST match the other class_ai_dev_usage sources (cursor,
-- claude_team, claude_enterprise, copilot) — union_by_tag does positional
-- UNION ALL. Keep column order/names/types identical to claude_team__ai_dev_usage.
--
-- Mapping notes:
--   tool='codex'                  — dev-tool discriminator (cf. 'claude_code', 'cursor').
--   session_count ← n_threads     — a Codex thread is the closest analogue to a coding session.
--   lines_added ← lines_added     — AI-accepted lines (from code_attribution.lines_of_code.added).
--   cost_cents ← NULL             — `credits` are Codex usage credits, not a currency amount.
--   Codex-only counters (credits, n_turns, text_tokens, current_streak) are
--   preserved in tool_action_breakdown_json so nothing is lost.
