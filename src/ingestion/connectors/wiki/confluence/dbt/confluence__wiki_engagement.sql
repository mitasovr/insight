-- Bronze → Silver: Confluence comments → class_wiki_engagement.
--
-- Grain: one row per (tenant, source, page, day) summarising comment
-- activity ON THAT PAGE on that day across all comment kinds. Feeds
-- "engagement vs ignored" page-level dashboards (issue #285).
--
-- AC#2 waiver note (issue #285): the issue's literal AC#2 asked for
-- per-event comment rows in `class_wiki_activity` keyed on `person_key`.
-- We deliberately deliver a per-page-day class instead — see the
-- design-note block on `class_wiki_engagement` in
-- `src/ingestion/silver/wiki/schema.yml` for the rationale.
--
-- Sources (4 bronze tables, all populated by the comments substreams
-- added in PR for #285):
--   wiki_footer_comments         top-level page-bottom comments
--   wiki_footer_comment_replies  replies to footer comments
--   wiki_inline_comments         top-level highlight-anchored comments
--   wiki_inline_comment_replies  replies to inline comments
--
-- Each row is shaped before UNION:
--   - `is_reply` = 1 if from a *_replies table
--   - `is_inline` = 1 if from a wiki_inline_*  table
--   - `day` = toDate(created_at) — Confluence timestamps are UTC
--   - `unique_key` (post-aggregate) = `{tenant}-{source}-{page_id}-{day}`
--     plain dash-concat per ADR-0004 (Option A — human-readable, prefix-
--     searchable, uniform across producers). Sibling models
--     `confluence__wiki_pages` / `confluence__wiki_activity` use the same
--     shape.
--
-- Derived metrics:
--   total_comments          all 4 streams combined
--   footer_comments         top-level footer (non-reply)
--   inline_comments         top-level inline (non-reply)
--   replies                 footer + inline replies
--   unique_commenters       distinct author_id across all 4 streams
--   unresolved_inline_count countIf(inline AND resolution_status='open' AND NOT is_reply)
--
-- Notes:
--   - Per ADR-0001 / ADR-0004 conventions: this model emits a `_version`
--     column (toUnixTimestamp64Milli of latest extraction) so the silver
--     RMT can deduplicate by `unique_key`. New comments on an existing
--     (page, day) bump `_version` and the silver merge picks them up.
--   - Author email resolution is intentionally NOT done here — engagement
--     is a per-page metric, not per-person. Drilldown to "who commented"
--     happens via the bronze tables or a future per-person staging model.
--   - Materialized as a view (cheap recompute); promote to incremental
--     keyed on (page_id, day) if comment volume grows past ~1M rows.
