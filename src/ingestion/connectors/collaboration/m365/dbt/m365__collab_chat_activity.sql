-- `getTeamsUserActivityUserDetail` exposes the following counters:
--   • privateChatMessageCount → 1:1 DMs            (correct → direct_messages)
--   • teamChatMessageCount    → channel posts      (per Microsoft Graph docs:
--                                                  "messages posted in a Teams
--                                                  channel, excluding replies".
--                                                  Despite the name, this is
--                                                  NOT group DMs.)
--   • postMessages            → channel thread starts
--   • replyMessages           → channel replies
--   • urgentMessages          → urgent-flagged

-- The report endpoint does NOT expose group-chat (multi-party DM) counts at
-- all. Microsoft's only path is the content-bearing `/chats` API with
-- `Chat.Read.All` scope. Until/unless that stream lands, group-chat counts
-- are honestly NULL for m365 (#431).
--
-- `direct_and_group_messages` (#266 sibling): for m365 only the DM half is
-- available; group is unsurfaced. We emit `privateChatMessageCount` (1:1
-- DMs only) and document the gap in silver schema. Cross-vendor aggregates
-- that compare with Slack's `total - channel` residual must account for
-- this asymmetry.
