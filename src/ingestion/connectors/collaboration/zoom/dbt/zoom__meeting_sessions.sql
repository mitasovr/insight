-- Zoom meeting-session stitching (issue #258) — extracted into its own
-- incremental staging model so that the downstream
-- `zoom__collab_meeting_activity` can stay `materialized='incremental'`
-- per DESIGN.md §3.7 (CR feedback on PR #284).
--
-- Grain: one row per `(tenant, source, uuid)`. Output column
-- `logical_meeting_id = concat(id, '#', cluster_idx)` collapses consecutive
-- sessions of the same Zoom Meeting ID whose end-of-prev → start-of-next
-- gap is ≤ `session_gap_seconds` (5 min) into a single logical meeting.
-- Host-drop rejoins (observed 11–147 s) thus map to the same logical
-- meeting; legitimate recurring meetings reusing the ID end up in
-- different clusters because their gaps are hours/days, not minutes.
--
-- Bounded rebuild window: bronze read is filtered to the last
-- `lookback_days` (90) of `_airbyte_extracted_at`. Anything older than
-- the window keeps the logical_meeting_id assigned at the time it was
-- written; the bound exceeds any plausible stitch interval (host-drop
-- gaps are seconds, never days) so we do not lose stitches at the
-- trailing edge.
--
-- `_version = now()` on every write means the ReplacingMergeTree always
-- keeps the most recent stitching decision per `uuid`. This is what lets
-- a late-arriving session re-cluster earlier sessions in the same chain:
-- the next incremental run rewrites every uuid in the 90-day window with
-- the new cluster_idx, and the higher `_version` wins on FINAL/argMax.
--
-- NULL `end_ts` handling: when a previous session in the chain has NULL
-- `end_ts` (Dashboard API has not yet flushed the close event), the
-- `dateDiff` over `lagInFrame(end_ts)` returns NULL. The CASE below
-- treats NULL gap as "new cluster", which conservatively SPLITS the chain
-- at that boundary. We intentionally do not fall back to
-- `lagInFrame(start_ts)` (a CodeRabbit suggestion on this PR): when
-- the previous session's end is unknown it may still be in progress,
-- and start-to-start could collapse two overlapping meetings. For
-- `meetings_attended`, over-splitting is the safer error than
-- over-merging — splitting may double-count one logical meeting,
-- merging would hide the second meeting entirely.
