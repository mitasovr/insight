#   ./e2e.sh test                       # full suite
#   ./e2e.sh test -k collab_emails_sent -v  # one test
#   ./e2e.sh shell                      # interactive bash inside the runner
#   ./e2e.sh build                      # rebuild the runner image
#   ./e2e.sh down                       # stop containers, clear volumes
#
# The runner image bakes in python+rust+deps so no host setup is required
# beyond Docker. See compose/Dockerfile.runner.
