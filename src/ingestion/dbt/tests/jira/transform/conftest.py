"""Rig for the Jira field-history transformation tests.

One ClickHouse, one dbt project, real models. A test seeds the three bronze
tables the chain reads, builds it, and reads the journal back:

    jira_fields + jira_issue + jira_issue_history
        -> dbt build --select tag:jira,tag:staging
        -> staging.jira__field_history_derived

Nothing is stubbed. Bronze is created from `scripts/connectors-ddl/jira.sql` —
the snapshot the connectors-ddl gate keeps byte-identical to what the real
connectors produce — so the tables have production's engines and column types,
including the plain MergeTree that `jira__bronze_promoted` then promotes.

Deliberately independent of `tests/e2e`: that rig boots MariaDB, Keycloak stubs
and the analytics binary to assert an HTTP response, none of which says anything
about these transformations. This lane needs a warehouse and dbt.

Connection comes from the environment with no defaults — a suite that silently
falls back to localhost either tests nothing or writes into somebody's
warehouse. See README.md for the two commands that set it up.
