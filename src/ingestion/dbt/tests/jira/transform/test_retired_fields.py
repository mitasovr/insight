"""Withdrawal of a field from an issue (spec §3.6).

Jira emits no changelog item when a field leaves a project's or an issue type's
configuration, or when the field is deleted outright: the key simply stops
appearing in the issue JSON. Without an event the journal's newest state stays
at a value the issue no longer has.

The tests here pin both halves of the rule — that an absent key produces the
withdrawal, and that a key present-and-empty does NOT. The second is the more
important one: a synthetic row emitted there would paper over a genuinely lost
clearing event, which is the defect class this whole change exists to expose.
