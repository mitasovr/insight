"""A changelog field the catalogue does not contain (spec §3.2).

Absence from `bronze_jira.jira_fields` cannot be classified even in principle:
without a catalogue row there is no `schema_type`, so no separator, no id side
and no cardinality. Before this the join to the classifier was an inner one and
the field's whole history disappeared without a trace — the same defect class as
the reported one, on the one input the design cannot resolve.

What it gets instead is one best-effort row per (issue, field) carrying the last
value as it arrived, plus a registry row so the exclusion is queryable, plus a
test that separates a field deleted long ago from one whose metadata simply has
not arrived yet.
