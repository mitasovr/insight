"""Multi-value fields whose changelog item carries ONE element.

Components, versions, issue links and attachments are system fields with
first-class changelog support: adding one emits an item with only a `to` side,
removing one an item with only a `from`. This is the single kind whose state
accumulates, so it is the only one where a mis-read event can corrupt a later
one — and the only one where the value at creation has to be reconstructed by
undoing the whole chain.
