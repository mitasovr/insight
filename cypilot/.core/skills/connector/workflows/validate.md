# Validate Connector

Checks that a connector package meets all requirements from the connector spec.

## Step 1: Automated structural validation (MANDATORY)

Before the checklist review, always run the automated validators:

```bash
./src/ingestion/tools/declarative-connector/source.sh validate-strict <category>/<name>
./src/ingestion/tools/declarative-connector/source.sh validate        <category>/<name>
```

- `validate-strict` — runs the Airbyte Builder UI JSON-schema check (no `$ref` resolution). This is the definitive compat test for the Builder UI. Must exit 0.
- `validate` — runs the CDK loader check (resolves `$ref` first). Lenient; must also exit 0.

If either fails, fix the reported per-path errors before proceeding with the checklist. See `src/ingestion/tools/declarative-connector/README.md` §"Debugging strict-validation errors".

## Step 2: Builder-UI compatibility checklist (manifest-only)

If `validate-strict` passed, these are already satisfied automatically — but eyeball them when reviewing a PR to catch intent mistakes:

- [ ] No whole-object `$ref` to `#/definitions/<X>` or `#/streams/<N>`. Only leaf-field `$ref` into `#/definitions/linked/<Component>/<field>` is allowed.
- [ ] Every `AddFields.fields[]` item has `type: AddedFieldDefinition`.
- [ ] `concurrency_level.default_concurrency` is a literal integer.
- [ ] `page_size` in `OffsetIncrement` / `CursorPagination` is either a literal integer OR a Jinja template like `"{{ config.get('x_page_size', 100) }}"` (both forms are accepted by the CDK and the Builder UI). Wire declared `*_page_size` config keys via the templated form so operator overrides take effect.
- [ ] Schema `$schema` is `http://json-schema.org/schema#` (not draft-07).
- [ ] Schema type arrays are `[type, "null"]`, not `["null", type]`.
- [ ] `check` block is present and placed BEFORE `definitions`.
- [ ] `version`, `type: DeclarativeSource`, `concurrency_level`, `metadata.autoImportSchema` present.
- [ ] Did NOT copy from `task-tracking/jira` (jira uses whole-object `$ref`; it is a known anti-template).

## Step 2b: Runtime-only pitfalls (checked by per-stream `read`, MANDATORY)

`validate-strict` does not catch these — only a live `read` against a real tenant does. Fail the connector review if any of these are present:

- [ ] `DatetimeBasedCursor` with `step` also has matching `cursor_granularity`. Missing `cursor_granularity` → CDK raises `ValueError: If step is defined, cursor_granularity should be as well`.
- [ ] No `format_datetime(...)` call inside an `AddedFieldDefinition.value` used as a cursor source. That Jinja expression may not render, leaving the literal template as the cursor value. Use native `%ms` / `%s` / `%s_as_float` / `%epoch_microseconds` in `cursor_datetime_formats` to parse epoch values directly from the source field.
- [ ] Every `record.get('X', {}).get('Y')` chain is replaced with `(record.get('X') or {}).get('Y')`. The `.get(key, default)` default only applies when the key is **missing**; it does NOT apply when the key is present with `null` value, and `None.get(...)` crashes the whole slice.
- [ ] Source API query syntax has been verified against a real tenant via `source.sh check`. YouTrack, Jira JQL, Salesforce SOQL each have distinct datetime and operator dialects — template substitution can produce syntactically valid but semantically wrong queries that `validate-strict` cannot detect.

## Step 2c: Per-stream `read` smoke test (MANDATORY)

Run the per-stream `read` loop from `connector-create.md` §5.6 and verify, for every stream:

- [ ] First-read record count > 0 (unless the source truly has no data).
- [ ] Error count = 0 in both first read and resume read (any `ERROR` / `FATAL` in the log is a blocker).
- [ ] Every emitted record contains `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key`.
- [ ] For substreams, the parent_key/partition_field uses the parent's stable internal id (e.g. `youtrack_id` from `record['id']`), NOT a nullable human-readable field like `id_readable` from `record.get('idReadable')` — a `null` value silently routes to `.../None/<endpoint>` which 404s and drops the slice.
- [ ] For incremental streams, a **resume read** (second run after capturing the emitted `STATE` message from stdout and writing it to `state.json`) returns a strict subset of the first-read records — usually zero. The skill's smoke-test script in `connector-create.md` §5.6 does this capture + persist + resume automatically. A naive "second consecutive read" without persisting state cannot validate cursor advancement (`source.sh read` writes Airbyte Protocol JSON to stdout but does not update `state.json` itself).

## Step 3: Spec-level checklist

Read connector package files and verify each item:

### Structure
- [ ] `connector.yaml` exists (nocode) or `Dockerfile` + `source_<name>/source.py` exists (CDK)
- [ ] `descriptor.yaml` exists with required fields (name, version, type, schedule, workflow, dbt_select, connection.namespace)
- [ ] `README.md` exists with prerequisites, K8s Secret fields, streams table, and multi-instance example
- [ ] K8s Secret example in `secrets/connectors/<name>.yaml.example` with `insight_source_id` annotation
- [ ] `dbt/` directory with at least one .sql model and schema.yml

### Manifest (nocode)
- [ ] `version: 7.0.4` or compatible
- [ ] `type: DeclarativeSource`
- [ ] `spec.connection_specification` has `insight_tenant_id` as required
- [ ] `spec.connection_specification` has `insight_source_id` as required
- [ ] All config fields use prefixes (insight_*, azure_*, github_*, etc.)
- [ ] No bare `tenant_id` or `client_id` in config fields
- [ ] AddFields includes `tenant_id` from `config['insight_tenant_id']`
- [ ] AddFields includes `source_id` from `config['insight_source_id']`
- [ ] AddFields includes `unique_key` with pattern: `{tenant_id}-{source_id}-{natural_key}`
- [ ] InlineSchemaLoader has `additionalProperties: true`
- [ ] Schema includes `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key` as string fields
- [ ] Nullable types used only where API actually returns null (not all fields)

### CDK (Python)
- [ ] `parse_response()` injects `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key`
- [ ] `unique_key` includes `tenant_id` and `source_id`
- [ ] `spec.json` has `insight_tenant_id` and `insight_source_id` as required
- [ ] All config fields in `spec.json` use source-specific prefixes (`insight_*`, `github_*`, `jira_*`, etc.)
- [ ] No bare field names (`token`, `client_id`, `tenant_id`, `start_date`, etc.) in `connectionSpecification.properties`

### Descriptor
- [ ] `name` matches directory name
- [ ] `connection.namespace` = `bronze_<name>`
- [ ] `dbt_select` includes connector tag with `+` suffix (e.g., `tag:m365+`)
- [ ] `schedule` is valid cron expression
- [ ] `workflow` field is present
- [ ] No `streams` block (streams are owned by Airbyte connector, discovered via `airbyte discover`)
- [ ] No `silver_targets` block (Silver targets are determined by dbt model tags via `dbt_select`)

### dbt Models
- [ ] Model name follows `<connector>__<domain>.sql` pattern
- [ ] `materialized='incremental'`
- [ ] `schema='staging'`
- [ ] Tags include connector name and `silver:class_<domain>`
- [ ] SELECT includes `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key`
- [ ] Uses `{{ source('bronze_<name>', '<stream>') }}`
- [ ] Has `{% if is_incremental() %}` block

### dbt schema.yml
- [ ] Source defined with `schema: bronze_<name>`
- [ ] Model has `tenant_id` with not_null test
- [ ] Model has `source_id` with not_null test
- [ ] Model has `unique_key` with not_null and unique tests

### Bronze Promotion (`promote_bronze_to_rmt`)

Airbyte writes bronze tables as plain `MergeTree`, so full-refresh streams accumulate duplicates across syncs. Every connector with a `dbt/` directory MUST migrate its bronze tables to `ReplacingMergeTree` via the `promote_bronze_to_rmt` macro (see `dbt/macros/promote_bronze_to_rmt.sql`). The bootstrap view MUST run BEFORE all other transformations.

- [ ] `dbt/<connector_snake>__bronze_promoted.sql` exists (where `<connector_snake>` is the connector name with hyphens converted to underscores, e.g. `bitbucket_cloud`, `ms_entra`, `claude_enterprise`)
- [ ] The bootstrap model is `materialized='view'`, uses `schema='staging'`, and tags the connector name (`tags=['<name>']`)
- [ ] For every Airbyte stream the connector emits, there is a `{% do promote_bronze_to_rmt(table='bronze_<name_snake>.<stream>', order_by='unique_key') %}` line
- [ ] No spurious `promote_bronze_to_rmt` calls reference streams that don't exist in the manifest / source
- [ ] Every other dbt model in `dbt/` that reads from `source('bronze_<name_snake>', '...')` declares the bronze_promoted dependency as the FIRST non-blank line above the `config` block:
  ```jinja
  -- depends_on: {{ ref('<connector_snake>__bronze_promoted') }}
  ```
  This makes dbt's DAG materialise the bootstrap view before any model that reads bronze.

Run the deterministic checker:

```bash
./airbyte-toolkit/validate-bronze-promoted.py <category>/<connector>
# or for a CI-friendly summary across the whole repo:
./airbyte-toolkit/validate-bronze-promoted.py --all --json
```

Exit 0 = PASS for the targeted connector(s); exit 2 = at least one FAIL. Rule IDs:

| Rule | What it checks |
|------|----------------|
| `BP-1` | `<name>__bronze_promoted.sql` file exists |
| `BP-2` | bootstrap is `materialized='view'` |
| `BP-3` | bootstrap uses `schema='staging'` |
| `BP-4` | bootstrap tags include connector name |
| `BP-5` | every stream has a `promote_bronze_to_rmt(table='bronze_<name>.<stream>')` call |
| `BP-6` | no `promote_bronze_to_rmt` call references an unknown stream (WARN) |
| `BP-7` | `promote_bronze_to_rmt` calls target the connector's own bronze namespace |
| `BP-8` | every `promote_bronze_to_rmt` call passes `order_by` |
| `BP-9` | every other model that reads bronze depends on `<name>__bronze_promoted` |

### Credentials Template
- [ ] `credentials.yaml.example` lists all required fields
- [ ] `insight_source_id` is included
- [ ] No real credentials in any tracked file
