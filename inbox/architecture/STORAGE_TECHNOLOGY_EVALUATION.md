# Storage Technology Evaluation for Insight Platform

> Technical Assessment: ClickHouse vs MariaDB ColumnStore vs PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB

**Status:** Draft for review  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Owner:** AI Transformation Team

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** ClickHouse is selected as the primary analytical storage for Insight based on critical requirements for incremental aggregations, native JSON support, and proven performance on analytical workloads.

**Key Decision Factors:**
1. ✅ Native incremental materialized views (critical for real-time dashboards)
2. ✅ First-class JSON type support (required for flexible schema)
3. ✅ Demonstrated performance advantage on analytical queries (3-50x depending on workload)
4. ✅ Production-proven scalability to billions of rows

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- Non-standard SQL dialect requires custom query generation (mitigated by dbt abstraction)
- Limited ACID transaction support (acceptable for append-only analytical workloads)

---

## Requirements Analysis

### Project-Specific Requirements

| Requirement | Priority | Justification | Source |
|-------------|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Incremental aggregations** | **Critical** | Real-time dashboards require auto-updating metrics without full table scans | [Product Spec: Data View Layer](./PRODUCT_SPECIFICATION.md#data-view-layer) |
| **JSON/nested data support** | **Critical** | Schema uses `value: JSON`, `dimensions: JSON` for extensible metrics | [Product Spec: Semantic Unification](./PRODUCT_SPECIFICATION.md#1-semantic-unification) |
| **Time-series optimization** | **Critical** | All events have temporal markers (`created_at`); metrics queried by time ranges | [Product Spec: Semantic Unification](./PRODUCT_SPECIFICATION.md#1-semantic-unification) |
| **50M+ row scalability** | **High** | 3-year projection with portfolio expansion | [Data Volume Projections](#data-volume-projections) (see below) |
| **Column-level lineage** | **Medium** | dbt integration for transformation tracking | [Product Spec: Data Catalog](./PRODUCT_SPECIFICATION.md#data-catalog) |
| **Standard SQL compatibility** | **Low** | AI-powered query generation abstracts SQL dialect differences | [Product Spec: AI Layer](./PRODUCT_SPECIFICATION.md#ai-layer-mcp-servers) |

### Data Volume Projections

**Assumptions:**
Data volume estimates based on integrated data sources from [Product Specification](./PRODUCT_SPECIFICATION.md#data-sources--coverage):

| Data Source | Events per Employee per Day | Annual Volume (250 working days) |
|-------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Git** (commits, file changes) | 5-10 | 1,250 - 2,500 |
| **MCP (AI Assistant)** | 2-4 | 500 - 1,000 |
| **Jira/YouTrack** (tasks, comments, status changes) | 10-20 | 2,500 - 5,000 |
| **M365 Emails** (sent + received) | 20-50 | 5,000 - 12,500 |
| **M365 Meetings** (attended, scheduled) | 3-5 | 750 - 1,250 |
| **Zulip** (messages, reactions) | 10-30 | 2,500 - 7,500 |
| **BambooHR/Workday** (leave, status, reviews) | 0.2 | 50 |
| **Office Attendance** (badge scans) | 2 | 500 |
| **Planned: Confluence** (page views, comments) | 2-5 | 500 - 1,250 |
| **Planned: Cursor AI** (direct IDE telemetry, beyond MCP) | 3-5 | 750 - 1,250 |
| **Total (current sources)** | **52-119** | **13,000 - 29,750** |
| **Total (with planned sources)** | **57-129** | **14,250 - 32,250** |

**Conservative estimate:** 17,000 events/employee/year (based on the Phase 1 deployment)  
**Aggressive estimate:** 30,000 events/employee/year (power users with all integrations)

---

**Year 1 (first company only):**
- **Employees:** 300
- **Sources:** Git, MCP, YouTrack, Zulip, M365, BambooHR, Office Attendance (7 sources)
- **Events/employee/year:** ~17,000 (based on actual source table)
- **Annual volume:** 300 × 17,000 = **5.1M rows/year**
- **Cumulative Year 1:** **5.1M rows**

**Year 2 (add second company):**
- **Employees:** 300 (first company) + 200 (second company) = 500
- **Sources:** Jira replaces YouTrack for the second company
- **Events/employee/year:** ~17,000 (same source mix)
- **Annual volume:** 500 × 17,000 = **8.5M rows/year**
- **Cumulative Year 2:** 5.1M + 8.5M = **13.6M rows**

**Year 3 (add third company):**
- **Employees:** 500 + 500 (third company) = 1,000
- **Sources:** Add Bitbucket, Confluence, Workday
- **Events/employee/year:** ~19,000 (additional Bitbucket + Confluence)
- **Annual volume:** 1,000 × 19,000 = **19M rows/year**
- **Cumulative Year 3:** 13.6M + 19M = **32.6M rows**

**Year 5 (Education expansion):**
- **Employees:** 1,000 (corporate)
- **Students:** 5,000 (universities + LPE)
- **Events/student/year:** ~5,000 (Canvas LMS, platform activity)
- **Total annual volume:** (1,000 × 19,000) + (5,000 × 5,000) = **44M rows/year**
- **Cumulative Year 5:** ~33M + 44M + 44M = **~120M rows**

---

**Conclusion:**

| Timeframe | Cumulative Rows | Primary Use Case |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Year 1** | 5.1M | Single company |
| **Year 3** | 32.6M | Portfolio (3 companies) |
| **Year 5** | 120M | Portfolio + Education segment |

**50M+ row scalability requirement justified** for 3-year horizon with portfolio expansion.  
**100M+ row scalability validates** long-term viability (5+ years, education segment).

### 2. MariaDB ColumnStore

**Official Site:** https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-columnstore/  
**License:** GPL v2  
**Latest Stable:** 25.10.1 (GA as of 2025-11-06)

#### Core Strengths

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **MySQL Compatibility** | ✅ Largely compatible | MariaDB SQL dialect with ColumnStore-specific DDL differences |
| **Mature Ecosystem** | ✅ 15+ years | Descended from InfiniDB, long-running project |
| **Distributed Architecture** | ✅ MPP, shared-nothing | Multi-node scale-out supported |

#### Critical Limitations for Insight

**1. Materialized Views**
- ❌ **Not supported natively**
  - ColumnStore does not support materialized views. Standard views are supported but re-execute query on each access.
- **Workaround:** Manual refresh via `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` + cron job
- **Impact:** Dashboard queries hit full tables, 10-100x slower for real-time metrics

**2. JSON Support**
- ⚠️ **JSON stored as LONGTEXT (no binary format)**
- **Source:** [MariaDB JSON Data Type](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/reference/data-types/string-data-types/json)
  - JSON is an alias for LONGTEXT with optional validation via `JSON_VALID()`
  - No native binary JSON storage
  - Indexing requires workarounds (generated/virtual columns extracting scalars)
  - ColumnStore generally targets index-free scan/MPP execution
- **Example Performance:**
  ```sql
  -- Full table scan required (ColumnStore doesn't use indexes by design)
  SELECT * FROM events
  WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(dimensions, '$.team_id') = 'backend';
  -- Even with generated column index, ColumnStore ignores it
  ```
- **Impact:** Queries on `value: JSON` and `dimensions: JSON` columns require full column scan + text parsing on every query

**3. Array/Nested Types**
- ❌ **Not supported**
- **Source:** [ColumnStore Data Types](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/columnstore-data-types/)
  - Standard SQL scalar types only (INT, DECIMAL, VARCHAR, TEXT, BLOB)
  - No ARRAY, JSON (binary), or structured types
  - MariaDB has array-like features in SQL/PSM, but not for ColumnStore table columns
- **Workaround:** Separate join tables or serialized TEXT
- **Impact:** Complex dimensional queries require multiple joins

#### Performance Evidence

**Independent Benchmarks:**
- **DZone Benchmark (2017)** — Column store comparison
   - **Source:** [DZone Article](https://dzone.com/articles/column-store-database-benchmarks-mariadb-columnsto)
   - **Dataset:** 100M rows with complex aggregations
   - **Result:** ClickHouse 2-20x faster than MariaDB ColumnStore
   - **Key Observations:**
     - MariaDB ColumnStore struggled with queries involving >3 JOINs
     - Memory consumption spiked on complex GROUP BY operations
     - ClickHouse maintained consistent performance across all query types

- **Community Benchmark Discussion (2017)** — Reddit analysis
   - **Source:** [Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/603kyu/column_store_database_benchmarks_mariadb/)
   - **Community Consensus:** MariaDB ColumnStore suitable for <10M rows, ClickHouse for >50M rows
   - **Notable Quote:** "MariaDB ColumnStore is a good choice if you need MySQL compatibility, but ClickHouse wins on pure analytical performance"

- **Tinybird Analysis (2024)** — Real-world comparison
   - **Source:** [Tinybird Blog](https://www.tinybird.co/blog/clickhouse-vs-mariadb-columnstore)
   - **Result:** ClickHouse 5-10x faster on real-time analytical queries
   - **Key Finding:** MariaDB ColumnStore better for hybrid OLTP/OLAP, ClickHouse for pure analytics

- **ClickBench (2023)** — Comprehensive OLAP benchmark
   - **Source:** [ClickBench](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/)
   - **Result:** MariaDB ColumnStore ranked **228 out of 252** systems tested
   - **Performance gap:** ClickHouse 50-1000x faster on standard analytical queries
   - **Key Finding:** MariaDB ColumnStore struggles with complex aggregations and JOINs

**Assessment Based on Direct Comparisons:**
- MariaDB ColumnStore **can handle 33M rows** for Insight's Year 3 dataset (architecture supports scale-out)
- Performance gap vs ClickHouse is **10-1000x on analytical queries** across multiple independent benchmarks
- **Critical Issue:** Memory management problems on multi-table JOINs (>3 tables) documented in DZone benchmark
- **ClickBench Result:** MariaDB ColumnStore ranked **228 out of 252** systems tested, indicating severe performance limitations on standard OLAP workloads
- **Impact for Insight:** DZone benchmark shows performance degradation on queries with >3 JOINs; Insight's data marts (person × team × time aggregations) may exceed this threshold

#### Scalability Evidence

### 3. PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB

**Official Sites:** 
- PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org
- TimescaleDB: https://www.timescale.com

**License:** PostgreSQL License (permissive)

#### Core Strengths

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **JSONB Support** | ✅ Native + indexed | [JSONB Docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html) |
| **Standard SQL** | ✅ Full ANSI compliance | Industry standard |
| **Mature Ecosystem** | ✅ 25+ years | Largest community |
| **Time-series (TimescaleDB)** | ✅ Extension | [TimescaleDB Docs](https://docs.timescale.com/) |

#### Limitations for Insight

**1. Incremental Materialized Views**
- ⚠️ **Requires pg_ivm extension** (experimental, as of v15)
- **Source:** [pg_ivm GitHub](https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm)
- **Status:** Not production-ready (alpha/beta stage)
- **Alternative:** `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` (full recalculation)

**2. Analytical Performance**
- ⚠️ **3-5x slower than ClickHouse** on complex aggregations
- **Source:** [Altinity Benchmark](https://altinity.com/blog/clickhouse-vs-postgresql-performance)
- **ClickBench Result:** PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB ranked **#217 out of 252** systems
- **Performance gap:** ClickHouse 50-1000x faster on analytical queries
- **Caveat:** Row-oriented storage less efficient than columnar

**3. Storage Efficiency**
- ⚠️ **Higher disk usage** vs columnar databases
- **Source:** [TimescaleDB Compression](https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/how-to-guides/compression/)
- Compression available but requires manual tuning

**4. Horizontal Scalability**
- ❌ **Distributed hypertables removed** from TimescaleDB 2.13+ (2023)
- **Source:** [TimescaleDB Announcement](https://www.timescale.com/blog/building-open-source-business-in-cloud-era-v2/)
- **Impact:** **Cannot scale beyond single node** for multi-node deployments in open-source version
- **Alternative:** Multi-node requires enterprise license (paid)
- **Year 3 Concern:** Single node may struggle with 33M rows under high query concurrency
- **Year 5 Blocker:** Single node **insufficient** for 120M rows (education segment)

#### Why Not Selected for Insight

| Blocker | Severity | Workaround Cost |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| No materialized views (native or incremental) | **Critical** | High — requires custom trigger system + separate aggregation tables |
| JSON as LONGTEXT (no binary format) | **Critical** | High — must denormalize all JSON fields to columns (defeats flexible schema) |
| No Array types | Medium | Medium — separate dimension tables |

**Decision:** Feature gaps are **architectural blockers**, not performance concerns.

## Risk Assessment

### ClickHouse Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Vendor lock-in (SQL dialect) | Medium | Medium | dbt abstraction + open-source license (Apache 2.0) |
| Community shift to closed-source | Low | High | Fork available if needed (strong open-source community) |
| Learning curve for team | Medium | Low | Strong documentation + active community |

### MariaDB ColumnStore Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Cannot meet real-time dashboard requirements | **High** | **Critical** | **None** (feature does not exist) |
| Complex JSON queries unacceptably slow | **High** | **High** | Denormalization (defeats flexible schema) |
| Limited community for ColumnStore | Medium | Medium | Enterprise support available (paid) |

### PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Poor analytical performance (#217/252 ClickBench) | **High** | **High** | Requires 50-1000x more hardware than ClickHouse |
| Cannot scale beyond single node (Year 3+) | **High** | **Critical** | Enterprise license required for multi-node (paid) |
| Incremental views not production-ready | **High** | **High** | Manual refresh (slower dashboards) |
| Single node insufficient for Year 5 (120M rows) | **High** | **Critical** | Migration to ClickHouse or enterprise TimescaleDB required |

---

## Alternative (If ClickHouse Blocked): PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB

**Rationale:**
- Mature, industry-standard database
- JSONB support adequate for flexible schema
- Can upgrade to `pg_ivm` when production-ready

**Trade-offs:**
- **Poor analytical performance:** ClickBench #217 out of 252 systems (50-1000x slower than ClickHouse)
- **Critical limitation: No horizontal scaling** in open-source version (enterprise-only feature)
- Manual materialized view refresh (slower dashboards)
- **3-5x more hardware** required for same performance as ClickHouse (conservative estimate based on Altinity benchmark; ClickBench suggests 50-1000x gap)

**Scalability Concerns:**
- **Year 1-2:** Single-node deployment adequate for 5-13M rows
- **Year 3:** Single-node may struggle with 33M rows under high query concurrency
- **Year 5:** Single-node **cannot handle** 120M rows (education segment) — requires either:
  - Migration to ClickHouse, or
  - Upgrade to TimescaleDB Enterprise (paid license)

**Why still considered alternative:**
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Standard SQL reduces vendor lock-in risk
- Better than MariaDB ColumnStore for JSON workloads
- Viable **only for Phase 1-2** (first two companies, <15M rows)
- **Not viable for Phase 3+** without enterprise license or migration
