"""
People / org-linkage seed.

Populates:

* `silver.class_people` — one row per person with `department_name`
  set to the team. The `insight.team_member` view joins on this.
* `bronze_bamboohr.employees` — emails + departments + supervisorEmail
  so `insight.people` can compute `org_unit_id` and the supervisor
  chain from a BambooHR-shaped table. The columns used by the
  view are workEmail, displayName, department, jobTitle, supervisorEmail.

`silver.class_people` lowercases its `email` column so case-insensitive
joins downstream (notably `insight.team_member`, which compares against
`lower(...)`) match cleanly. `bronze_bamboohr.employees` keeps the
original casing that a real BambooHR feed would deliver — fine here
because the seed roster (`profiles.py`) already uses lowercase
addresses end-to-end, so no identities split in practice. If a future
roster introduces mixed-case emails, restore `.lower()` on `workEmail`
and `supervisorEmail` below or fix the downstream view to compare
case-insensitively.

Both tables use ReplacingMergeTree so re-inserting the same `_version`
is safe; we TRUNCATE first anyway for cleanliness.
