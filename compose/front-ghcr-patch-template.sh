# Compose-only patch for the insight-front ghcr image.
#
# The published image's nginx template deliberately has no /api proxy —
# in k8s the cluster ingress routes /api/* straight to the api-gateway
# pod, so the FE pod never sees those requests. The docker-compose dev
# stack has nothing in front of the FE pod, so /api needs to land
# locally.
#
# Rather than maintain a parallel template (drift risk every time the
# upstream changes), we insert just the /api location block into the
# upstream template at a known marker, then chain to the original
# entrypoint which envsubsts and starts nginx. The patch is idempotent
# so container restarts don't stack copies.
#
# If the upstream template ever drops the marker line, this script is a
# no-op and the symptoms revert to the original "GET /api → 200 HTML,
# POST /api → 405" failure mode — observable, not silent.
